# AES-128
A basic implementation of AES-128.

This implementation does not aim at being optimized nor complete.
It is only a basic implementation of AES-128 (ECB only) which is written to be very close to the explanations given in Wikipedia.

The main purpose is to be easy to read and to play around with the AES concepts.
