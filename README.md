# AES-128
A basic implementation of AES-128.

This implementation does not aim at being optimized nor complete nor secure against attacks.
It is only a basic implementation of AES-128 (ECB, CBC and CTR) which is written 
to be very close to the explanations given in Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#High-level_description_of_the_algorithm

The main purpose is to be easy to read and to play around with the AES concepts.
